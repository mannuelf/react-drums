# Welcome

React-drums Machine is a drum machine built with [React](https://reactjs.org/). xIs a side project designed to be used a learning and experimationation tool.

The code is in constant flux and extremely over engineered 😆. I use React drums to experiment with and keep my favourite technologies top of mind. So if you're keen to be enthralled, intrigued challenged and disgusted with me 😜 all at the same time, jump right in here are some links and docs to get you started.
