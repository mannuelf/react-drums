## Introduction

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/387164b2-b480-4505-aff2-c3eb867b69c0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/react-drums-docs/deploys)

React drums is a virtual drum machine built with React and Node.js using an Apollo GraphQL server. I love coding, music, Native Instruments software & hardware. So why not build a virtual Drum Machine [^1] to play around with all of the tech.

The code is always changing, feel free to change it also and i'm certain it's overcooked and undercooked in places 😆. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed building it.
