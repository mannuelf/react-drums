## Introduction

React-drums is a drum machine built with React and Node.js using an Apollo GraphQL server. I love coding, music, Native Instruments software & hardware. So why not build a virtual Drum Machine [^1] to play around with all of the tech.

The code is in constant flux and is for sure overcooked and undercooked in places 😆. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed building it.
